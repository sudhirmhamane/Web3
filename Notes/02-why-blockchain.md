# Why Blockchain?

This note explains why blockchain technology was introduced and what problems it aims to solve compared to traditional systems.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across 
many computers, ensuring data security and transparency. It operates without a central 
authority, using cryptographic techniques to verify and add new transactions.

---

## Purpose of Blockchain?

The purpose of blockchain is to create a network of computers that agree upon a common 
state of data. This ensures that:

* Any person or organization can participate in the process
* No single person or organization can control the process

Blockchain enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions without the need for a 
central authority

## Problem with Traditional Systems

In traditional (centralized) systems:

* Data is stored on a single server or controlled by one organization
* Users must trust a central authority
* A single failure can bring down the entire system

Examples include banks, social media platforms, and centralized databases.

---

## Key Issues in Centralized Systems

### 1. Trust Dependency

Users must trust institutions to:

* Store data securely
* Act honestly
* Not manipulate records

### 2. Single Point of Failure

* Server outages affect all users
* Systems are vulnerable to hacks and attacks

### 3. Data Manipulation

* Records can be altered or deleted
* Lack of transparency

### 4. Middlemen

* Banks, payment gateways, and platforms act as intermediaries
* Increased cost, delays, and restrictions

---

## What Blockchain Solves

Blockchain introduces a decentralized approach where:

* No single authority controls the data
* Records are immutable once added
* Transactions are verified by a network

---

## Core Reasons for Blockchain

### 1. Decentralization

* Data is distributed across multiple nodes
* No central control

### 2. Transparency

* Publicly verifiable transactions
* Anyone can audit the system

### 3. Immutability

* Once data is recorded, it cannot be changed
* Prevents fraud and manipulation

### 4. Trustless System

* Trust is placed in code and cryptography
* No need to trust individuals or organizations

### 5. Peer-to-Peer Transactions

* Direct transfer of value
* No intermediaries

---

## Real-World Use Cases

* Digital payments without banks
* Secure and transparent financial systems
* Supply chain tracking
* Digital identity and ownership

## How to Create A New Currency with Blockchain

There is a need for trustless, anonymized and decentralized form of money, blockchain solves it for us.

### 1. Avoiding Central Ownership
* Centralized control over currency can lead to misuse of power and lack of transparency.

* Blockchain technology eliminates the need for a central authority, distributing control among multiple nodes.

### 2. Trustless System
* Blockchain enables the creation of currency without needing to trust a central autority.

* Transactions are verified by consensus mechanisms, ensuring security and integrity.

### 3. Anonymization
* Blockchain technology supports anonymized transactions, protecting the privacy of users while maintaining transparency of the overall system.

### 4. Decentralization
* Decentralized money operates on a network of nodes, preventing any single entity from having control and reducing the risk of manipulation or failure.

## How Does the Blockchain Works

### Blocks: 

* Data is stored in the "blocks"
* Each block contains:
1. A list of transactions
2. A timestamp
3. A cryptographic has of the previous block.

### Chain:

* Blocks are linked together in a chronological order

* This creates a "Chain" of blocks, hence the name is "blockchain"

## Summary

Blockchain was created to eliminate the need for centralized trust, reduce intermediaries, and provide a transparent, secure, and immutable system for data and value exchange.

This concept forms the foundation of Web3 and smart contract development.
