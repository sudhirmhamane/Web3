# Web Evolution: Web1 to Web3


## 1. What is the Web?

The World Wide Web enables users to access information, share data, and interact with applications. Its evolution reflects growing needs for interaction, scale, and trust.

## 2. Web1 – Read-Only Web

**Time Period:** 1990–2004

**Overview:**
Web1 was the first stage of the web where users could only read information. Websites were static and controlled by site owners.

**Technologies:**

* HTML
* Basic CSS
* HTTP
* Static servers

**Characteristics:**

* One-way communication
* No user accounts
* No interaction (comments, likes)

**Examples:**

* Early Yahoo
* Personal blogs
* News websites

**Limitations:**

* No user-generated content
* No personalization
* No social interaction

**Summary:** Web1 focused on information publishing only.

## 3. Web2 – Read and Write Web

**Time Period:** 2004–Present

**Overview:**
Web2 enabled users to create, share, and interact with content. This led to social media, cloud services, and large-scale platforms.

**Technologies:**

* JavaScript
* Frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)
* Backend languages (Node.js, Java, Python)
* Cloud infrastructure
* Databases (MySQL, MongoDB)

**Characteristics:**

* User-generated content
* Social platforms
* Real-time interaction
* Authentication using email and passwords

**Examples:**

* Facebook
* Instagram
* YouTube
* Twitter
* Amazon
* Google

---

## Problems with Web2

**Centralization:**

* Platforms control servers and data
* Single points of failure

**Data Ownership:**

* User data owned by companies
* Data monetized through advertising

**Censorship:**

* Accounts and content can be removed

**Middlemen:**

* Banks and platforms control payments
* High commissions and fees

**Trust Dependency:**

* Users must trust centralized companies
* Limited transparency

## 4. Web3 – Read, Write, and Own Web

**Time Period:** 2014–Future

**Overview:**
Web3 introduces decentralization, allowing users to own data, control identity, and transact without intermediaries.

**Technologies:**

* Blockchain
* Smart contracts
* Cryptography
* Wallets (e.g., MetaMask)
* Solidity

---

## Core Components of Web3

**Blockchain:**

* Distributed ledger
* Immutable records
* No central authority

**Smart Contracts:**

* Self-executing programs
* Written in Solidity
* Deployed on blockchains

**Cryptocurrency:**

* Peer-to-peer digital money
* No banks required

**Wallets:**

* Decentralized authentication
* Identity based on private keys

---

## Key Contributors

**Bitcoin (2008):**

* Created by Satoshi Nakamoto
* Introduced decentralized digital currency

**Ethereum (2015):**

* Created by Vitalik Buterin
* Enabled smart contracts
* Foundation for Web3 applications

**Gavin Wood:**

* Ethereum co-founder
* Coined the term Web3
* Founder of Polkadot

## Web2 vs Web3 Comparison

| Feature        | Web2            | Web3           |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Data ownership | Platform        | User           |
| Authentication | Email/Password  | Wallet         |
| Backend        | Central servers | Blockchain     |
| Trust model    | Company-based   | Code-based     |
| Payments       | Banks           | Cryptocurrency |

## Web3 Use Cases

**Decentralized Finance (DeFi):**

* Uniswap, Aave
* Financial services without banks

**NFTs:**

* Digital ownership of assets

**DAOs:**

* Decentralized organizations
* Community-driven governance

---

## Challenges of Web3

* High transaction fees
* Complex user experience
* Security risks and scams
* Regulatory uncertainty

---

## Final Summary

* Web1 focused on reading information
* Web2 enabled interaction and content creation
* Web3 adds ownership and decentralization

Web3 aims to provide transparency, user control, and trust through code.

---

## Developer Perspective

* Backend logic is handled by smart contracts (Solidity)
* Frontend typically uses modern frameworks (React)
* Requires strong understanding of security and decentralized systems
